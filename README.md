# Keratoconus_Detection_AI
Keratoconus is a progressive, non-inflammatory corneal ectasia characterised by thinning and bulging of the cornea into a conical shape. This morphological change disrupts the normal refractive function of the eye, which leads to myopia, irregular astigmatism and corneal scarring in advanced cases.
